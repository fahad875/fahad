           <h3>What are the different oil and gas sectors?</h3>   
            <ul>
             <li><p>The energy sector has three key areas: Upstream, midstream and downstream.</p> </li>
             <li><p>What is upstream? - Upstream is E&P (exploration and exploration). <br/>  This involves the search for underwater and underground natural gas fields or crude oil fields <br/> and the drilling of exploration wells and drilling into established wells to recover oil and gas.</p> 
             <li><p>What is midstream? - Midstream entails the transportation, storage, and processing of oil and gas. <br> Once resources are recovered, it has to be transported to a refinery, which is often in a completely <br> different geographic region compared to the oil and gas reserves.  Transportation can include <br> anything from tanker ships to pipelines and trucking fleets. </p>  </li>
             <li><p>What is downstream? - Downstream refers to the filtering of the raw materials obtained during <br> the upstream phase. This means refining crude oil and purifying natural gas. The marketing and <br> commercial distribution of these products to consumers and end users in a number of forms <br> including natural gas, diesel oil, petrol, gasoline, lubricants, kerosene, jet fuel, asphalt, <br> heating oil, LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) as well as a number of other types of petrochemicals.</p> <br/></li>

            <h3>Basic Concept</h3>   
            <ul>
             <li> <p>Upstream is a term used in the oil industry  which refers to the searching for, the recovery and production of crude oil and natural gas.</p> </li>
             <li> <p> The upstream sector includes </p> </li>
             <li> <p>Exploration – the searching for potential onshore or offshore oil and gas reservoirs, and the drilling of exploratory wells 
             Production and maintenance of wells and facilities to recover and bring the crude oil and/or raw natural gas to the surface plant and to process the produced hydrocarbons.</p> </li> 
             <div> <img src="1.jpg" alt="1"width=450px height="350px"> </div>
             <li> <p>Within the upstream sector, a typical oil and gas operating cycle sees several and different phases which aim to target varied goals using specialized technologies.</p> </li>
             <li> <p> The term “Petroleum” refers to both crude oil and natural gas. </p></li>
             <li> <p> These are mixtures of hydrocarbons which are molecules, in various shapes and sizes, <br> of hydrogen and carbon atoms, and different mixtures of hydrocarbons have different uses and different economic values.</p></li>

             <h3>Understanding Oil Production Numbers</h3>
             <ul>  
             <li><p>E&P companies measure oil production in barrels. One barrel, usually abbreviated as bbl, is equal to 42 U.S. gallons.7﻿ Companies often describe production in terms of bbl per day or bbl per quarter.</p> <br></li>
             <li><p>A common methodology in the oil patch is to use a prefix of "M" to indicate 1,000 and a prefix of "MM" to indicate 1 million. Therefore, 1,000 barrels are commonly denoted as Mbbl, and 1 million barrels are denoted as MMbbl. For example, when an E&P company reports production of seven Mbbl per day, it means 7,000 barrels of oil per day.</p><br></li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
             <div id="EXPLAINATION ABOUT GAS PRODUCTION"><p>3</p></div>
             <h3>Gas Production Numbers Explained</h3>
             <ul>
             <li><p>Natural gas production is described in terms of cubic feet. Similar to the convention for oil, the term Mmcf means 1 million cubic feet of gas. Bcf means 1 billion cubic feet and Tcf represents 1 trillion cubic feet.</p><br></li>
             <li><p>Note that natural gas futures trade on the CME Group futures exchange, but are not measured in cubic feet. Instead, the futures contract is based on 1 million British thermal units, or MMBtu, which is roughly equivalent to 970 cubic feet of gas. For this reason, investors frequently think of an Mcf of gas as being roughly equivalent to one MBtu.</p></li> 
             <li><p>E&P companies often describe their production in units of barrels of oil equivalent (BOE). To calculate BOE, companies usually convert gas production into oil equivalent production. In this calculation, one BOE has the energy equivalent of 6,040 cubic feet of gas or roughly one bbl to six Mcf.
              Oil quantity can be converted into gas quantity in a similar fashion and gas producers often refer to production in terms of gas equivalency using the term Mcfe.</p></li>
             <li><p>E&P companies report their oil and natural gas reserves—the quantity of oil and gas they own that is still in the ground—in the same bbl and mcf terms. Reserves are often used to value E&P companies and make predictions for their revenue and earnings. Public oil and gas companies are required to disclose proven oil and gas reserve quantities as supplementary information, but not as part of their financial statement.</p></li>
             <li><p>Of course, new reserves are an essential source of future revenue, so E&P companies spend a lot of time and money exploring for new untapped reservoirs. If an E&P company stops exploring, it will have only a finite amount of reserves and a depleting quantity of oil and gas. Revenue will inevitably decline over time. In short, E&P companies can only maintain or grow revenue by acquiring or finding new reserves.</p></li>
            </ul>

              <h3>Drilling and Service Companies</h3>
              <div><img src="4.jpg" alt="jpg"height="400px"width="600px"  ></div>
              <ul>
                <li><p>E&P companies do not usually own their own drilling equipment or <br> employ a drilling rig staff. Instead, they hire contract drilling companies to <br> drill wells for them and the contract drilling companies generally charge for <br> their services based on the amount of time they work for an E&P company. <br> Drillers do not generate revenue that is tied directly to oil and gas <br> production, as is the case for E&P companies.</p></li>
                <li><p>Once a well is drilled, various activities are involved in generating <br> and maintaining its production over time. These activities are called <br> well servicing and can include logging, cementing, casing, perforating, <br> fracturing, and maintenance. Oil drilling and oil servicing thus <br> represent two different business activities within the oil and gas industry.</p></li>
                <li><p>As is the case for drilling, many public companies are involved in well service activity. The revenue of service companies is tied to the activity level in the oil and gas industry. Rig count and utilization rates are indicators of the amount of activity happening in the United States at any given time.</p></li>
